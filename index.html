    <div class="maintext">
        <p> Welcome! My artist pseudonym is "Harpy" from my username "Harpaleon". (This name comes from a poem translation by Anne Carson.) This site is an archive for my work. Photography and visual art projects can be found in the gallery,
            while the library holds my creative writing. The blog is for essays, CNF, opinions, journals, etc. </p>
        <p>I'm studying Visual Arts, and working for <a href="https://www.unitpitt.ca/">UNIT/PITT</a> and
            <a href="https://gibson.sfu.ca/">The Marianne and Edward Gibson Art Museum.</a> I've worked everywhere from retail to farms, and find my passion
        is for supporting the arts through community engagement. I specifically have an interest in art as play and discovery, so I love working with kids. I work to organize art-based activities for a summer camp
    in Ontario, and volunteer at the Gibson with Pietro Sammarco to facilitate artist-led studio sessions for kids.</p> 
    <p>My own practice is entrenched in and inspired by the real world, with a focus on locality. Exploring the Salish Sea with <a href="https://merveilles.town/@797">Shmuel</a>
       has given me a deep appreciation for coastal marine ecosystems, while living in many locations and working with marginalized communities gives me
       a strong sense for social justice. My work aims to meld the socioeconomic and political conditions we live in with
    "apolitical" elements of the "natural" world. Of course, nature is political (land rights, the climate crisis, etc.), and we are a part of nature.
    So, really, all of this means nothing, and I make art about the world.</p>
    <p>In addition to materials-based and traditional visual art (shells and feathers vs oil painting), I'm also intrigued by the role technology plays in art.
        I think it undermines one's art to have a practice divorced from modern reality. I'm a member of <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/merveilles.html">Merveilles</a>, a community of artists and
        technologists brought together by Devine Lu Linvega and Rekka Bellum. My account on the Merveilles Mastodon can be found below, in the external links section.
Although with much strife I coded this site, I'm not a programmer. I typically work within the roles of game designer, artist, beta tester, and community manager. I'm deeply interested
in game design. As the <a href="https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/">quadplay✜</a> community manager, I run a server (see external links) for its programmers and players.
quadplay✜, stylized like so, is a fantasy console created by Morgan McGuire for creating and playing retro-style video games on any device.
